- 👋 Hi, I’m @CJBaker77 here on GitHub, and BeansBlog on Nexus.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to create immersive character development mods.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything, I am so new I barely know how to ask a question!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my current project - a marriage expansion mod featuring Lance.
- 📫 How to reach me drop me a line on my Nexus mod page (Saucy_Lance)
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a retired "old lady" teaching myself how to mod, which makes me X2000-level cool in the eyes of my children and their friends. I started playing PC games in September of 2024 and love Stardew Valley!
